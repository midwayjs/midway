   async upload(@Files() files, @Fields() fields) {
     /*
     files = [
       {
         filename: 'test.pdf', // original name of the file
         data: '/var/tmp/xxx.pdf', // when the mode is file, it is the server temporary file address
         fieldname: 'test1', // form field name
         mimeType: 'application/pdf', // mime
       },
       {
         filename: 'test.pdf', // original name of the file
         data: ReadStream, // when the mode is stream, it is the server temporary file address
         fieldname: 'test2', // form field name
         mimeType: 'application/pdf', // mime
       },
       // ...file supports uploading multiple files at the same time
     ]

     */
     return {
       files,
       fields
     }
   }
}
```

:::caution

If the swagger component is enabled at the same time, please be sure to add the type of the upload parameter (the type corresponding to the decorator, and the type in @ApiBody), otherwise an error will be reported. For more information, please refer to the file upload section of swagger.

## configuration

### default allocation

The default configuration is as follows, and generally does not need to be modified.

```typescript
// src/config/config.default.ts
import { uploadWhiteList } from '@midwayjs/upload';
import { tmpdir } from 'os';
import { join } from 'path';

export default {
   //...
   upload: {
     // mode: UploadMode, the default is file, that is, upload to the temporary directory of the server, and can be configured as stream
     mode: 'file',
     // fileSize: string, the maximum upload file size, the default is 10mb
     fileSize: '10mb',
     // whitelist: string[], file extension whitelist
     whitelist: uploadWhiteList. filter(ext => ext !== '.pdf'),
     // tmpdir: string, temporary storage path for uploaded files
     tmpdir: join(tmpdir(), 'midway-upload-files'),
     // cleanTimeout: number, how long the uploaded file is automatically deleted in the temporary directory, the default is 5 minutes
     cleanTimeout: 5 * 60 * 1000,
     // base64: boolean, set whether the original body is in base64 format, the default is false, generally used for compatibility with Tencent Cloud
     base64: false,
     // Parse the file information in the body only when the matching path reaches /api/upload
     match: /\/api\/upload/,
   },
}

```



### Upload mode - file

`file` is the default and recommended by the framework.

Configure upload mode as `file` string, or use `UploadMode.File` exported by `@midwayjs/upload` package.

When using the file mode, the `data` obtained from `this.ctx.files` is the `temporary file address` of the uploaded file on the server, and the content of this file can be obtained later by `fs.createReadStream` and other methods.

When using the file mode, it supports uploading multiple files at the same time, and multiple files will be stored in `this.ctx.files` in the form of an array.



:::caution

When the `file` mode is adopted, since the upload component will match according to the `method` of the request and some of the iconic content in `headers` when receiving the request, if it is considered to be a file upload request, the request will be Parse and `write` the files in it to the temporary cache directory of the server. You can set the path that allows parsing files through `match` or `ignore` configuration of this component.

After configuring `match` or `ignore`, you can ensure that your normal post and other request interfaces will not be illegally used by users for uploading, and you can `avoid` the risk of the server cache being full.

You can check the section `Configuring the upload path to allow (match) or ignore (ignore)` below to configure it.

:::




### Upload mode - stream

Configure upload mode as `stream` string, or use `UploadMode.Stream` exported by `@midwayjs/upload` package to configure.


When using the stream mode, the `data` obtained from `this.ctx.files` is `ReadStream`, and then the data stream can be transferred to other `WriteStream` or `TransformStream` through `pipe` and other methods.


When using stream mode, only one file is uploaded at the same time, that is, there is only one file data object in `this.ctx.files` array.


In addition, the stream mode `will not` generate temporary files on the server, so there is no need to manually clear the temporary file cache after getting the uploaded content.



### Upload whitelist

Through the `whitelist` attribute, configure the file extensions that are allowed to be uploaded. If `null` is configured, the extensions will not be verified.

:::caution

If the configuration is `null`, the suffix name of the uploaded file will not be verified. If the file upload mode (mode=file) is adopted, it may be used by attackers to upload `.php`, `.asp` and other suffixes The WebShell implements the attack behavior.

Of course, since the `@midwayjs/upload` component will `rerandomly generate` the file name of the uploaded temporary file, as long as the developer `does not return` the address of the uploaded temporary file to the user, then even if the user uploads For some unexpected files, there is no need to worry too much about being used.

:::


If the uploaded file suffix does not match, a `400` error will be responded, and the default values are as follows:

```ts
'.jpg',
'.jpeg',
'.png',
'.gif',
'.bmp',
'.wbmp',
'.webp',
'.tif',
'.psd',
'.svg',
'.js',
'.jsx',
'.json',
'.css',
'.less',
'.html',
'.htm',
'.xml',
'.pdf',
'.zip',
'.gz',
'.tgz',
'.gzip',
'.mp3',
'.mp4',
'.avi',
```

The default suffix whitelist can be obtained through the `uploadWhiteList` exported in the `@midwayjs/upload` package.

In addition, midway upload component, in order to avoid some `malicious users`, uses some technical means to `forge` some extensions that can be truncated, so it will filter the binary data of the obtained extensions, and only support `0x2e` (that is, the English dot `.`), `0x30-0x39` (that is, the number `0-9`), `0x61-0x7a` (that is, the lowercase letters `a-z`) are used as extensions, and other characters will be Automatically ignored.



### MIME type checking

Some `malicious users` will try to modify the extension of `.php` and other WebShells to `.jpg` to bypass the whitelist filtering rules based on the extension. In some server environments, this jpg file will still be used as PHP scripts to execute, pose a security risk.

Therefore, the `@midwayjs/upload` component provides the `mimeTypeWhiteList` configuration parameter **【Please note that this parameter has no default value setting, that is, no verification by default】**, you can set the allowed file MIME format through this configuration, A rule is a `secondary array` consisting of an array `[extension, mime, [...moreMime]]`, for example:

```typescript
// src/config/config.default.ts
import { uploadWhiteList } from '@midwayjs/upload';
export default {
   //...
   upload: {
     //...
     // extension whitelist
     whitelist: uploadWhiteList,
     // Only the following file types are allowed to be uploaded
     mimeTypeWhiteList: {
       '.jpg': 'image/jpeg',
       // Multiple MIME types can also be set, for example, the following files that allow the .jpeg suffix are jpg or png
       '.jpeg': ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'],
       // other types
       '.gif': 'image/gif',
       '.bmp': 'image/bmp',
       '.wbmp': 'image/vnd.wap.wbmp',
       '.webp': 'image/webp',
     }
   },
}
```


You can also use the `DefaultUploadFileMimeType` variable provided by the `@midwayjs/upload` component as the default MIME validation rule, which provides commonly used `.jpg`, `.png`, `.psd` and other file extensions MIME data:

```typescript
// src/config/config.default.ts
import { uploadWhiteList, DefaultUploadFileMimeType } from '@midwayjs/upload';
export default {
   //...
   upload: {
     //...
     // extension whitelist
     whitelist: uploadWhiteList,
     // Only the following file types are allowed to be uploaded
     mimeTypeWhiteList: DefaultUploadFileMimeType,
   },
}
```

You can query the file format and corresponding MIME mapping through `https://mimetype.io/`. For the MIME identification of files, we use [file-type@16](https://www. npmjs.com/package/file-type) this npm package, please note the file types it supports.

:::info

The MIME type verification rule is only applicable to the file upload mode `mode=file`, and after setting this verification rule, since the file content needs to be read for matching, the upload performance will be slightly affected.

However, we still recommend that you set the `mimeTypeWhiteList` parameter if possible, which will improve your application security.

:::



### Configure match or ignore

When the upload component is enabled, when the `method` of the request is one of `POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH`, if it is judged that `headers['content-type']` of the request contains `multipart/form-data` and When `boundary` is set, it will `**automatically enter**` upload file parsing logic.

This will cause: If the user may manually analyze the request information of the website, manually call any interface such as `post`, and upload a file, it will trigger the parsing logic of the `upload` component, and create a file in the temporary directory The temporary cache of uploaded files will generate unnecessary `load` on the website server, and may `affect` the normal business logic processing of the server in severe cases.

Therefore, you can add `match` or `ignore` configuration to the configuration to set which api paths are allowed to upload.






## Temporary files and cleanup


If you use the `file` mode to get uploaded files, the uploaded files will be stored in the folder pointed to by the `tmpdir` option in the configuration of the `upload` component that you set in the `config` file.

You can control the automatic temporary file cleanup time by using `cleanTimeout` in the configuration, the default value is `5 * 60 * 1000`, that is, the uploaded file will be automatically cleaned up after `5 minutes`, set it to `0` To disable the automatic cleaning function.

You can also actively clean up the temporary files uploaded by the current request by calling `await ctx.cleanupRequestFiles()` in the code.



## Safety warning

1. Please pay attention to whether to enable `extension whitelist` (whiteList), if the extension whitelist is set to `null`, it may be used by attackers to upload `.php`, `.asp` and other WebShells.
2. Please pay attention to whether to set `match` or `ignore` rules, otherwise common `POST/PUT` and other interfaces may be exploited by attackers, resulting in increased server load and large space occupation.
3. Please pay attention to whether to set the `file type rule` (fileTypeWhiteList), otherwise the attacker may forge the file type to upload.



## Front-end file upload example

### 1. The form of html form

```html
<form action="/api/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
   Name: <input type="text" name="name" /><br />
   File: <input type="file" name="testFile" /><br />
   <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

### 2. Fetch FormData method

```js
const fileInput = document. querySelector('#your-file-input');
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);

fetch('/api/upload', {
   method: 'POST',
   body: formData,
});
```
