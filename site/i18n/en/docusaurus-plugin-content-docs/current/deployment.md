# Start-up and deployment

Midway provides a lightweight launcher to launch your application. null


## Local development


Here are two ways to use the `dev` command for local development.


### Quickly start a single service


In local development, Midway provides a `dev` command startup framework in `package.json`, such:
```json
{
  "script": {
    "dev": "midway-bin dev --ts"
  }
}
```
This is the most concise command, it has the following characteristics:


- 1. Use `--ts` to specify the TypeScript(ts-node) environment to start
- 2. Use the built-in API(@midwayjs/core `initializeGlobalApplicationContext`) to create a service without `bootstrap.js`
- 3. Single process operation

Run the following command on the command line to execute.
```bash
$ npm run dev
```



### Specify the portal to start the service

Because the local dev command is usually different from the initialization parameters of the `bootstrap.js` startup file, some users are worried about the inconsistency between local development and online development, such as testing links.

In this case, you can directly pass an entry file to the `dev` command and use the entry file to start the service.

```json
{
  "script": {
    "dev": "midway-bin dev --ts --entryFile=bootstrap.js"
  }
}
```



## Deploy to a normal server


### The difference between post-deployment and local development


After deployment, some places are different from local development.


**1. Changes in the node environment**


The biggest difference is that after the server is deployed, node will be used directly to start the project instead of ts-node, which means that the `*.ts` file will no longer be read.


**2. Changes in the loading directory**


After the server is deployed, only the built `dist` directory is loaded, while the local development `src` directory is loaded.

|  | Local | Server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| appDir | Project root directory | Project root directory |
| baseDir | src directory under the root directory of the project | dist directory under the root directory of the project |

**3. Changes in the environment**


In the server environment, `NODE_ENV=production` is generally used. Many libraries will provide better performance methods in this environment, such as enabling caching, error reporting, etc.

**4. Log files**


In the general server environment, logs are not printed to the logs directory of the project, but other directories that are not affected by project updates, such as `home/admin/logs`. This fixed directory also facilitates other tools to collect logs.


### Deploy process


The entire deployment is divided into several parts. Since Midway is written TypeScript, it adds a build step to the traditional JavaScript code. The entire deployment process is as follows.

![](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01wSpCuM27pWGTDeDyK_!!6000000007846-2-tps-2212-242.png)
Since deployment is very relevant to the platform and environment, we will demonstrate it with Linux below, and other platforms can refer to it as appropriate.


### Compile code and install dependencies


Since Midway project is TypeScript written, we compile it before deployment. In this example, we have written the build script in advance and run the `npm run build` command. If not, add the following `build` command to `package.json`.
```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts ": {
    "build": "midway-bin build -c"
  },
}
```

:::info
Although it is not necessary, it is recommended that you perform the test and lint first.
:::


Generally speaking, the deployment build environment and the local development environment are two sets. We recommend building your application in a clean environment.


The following code is a sample script that you can save as `build.sh`.

```bash
## Server build (code downloaded)
$ npm install	# installation and development period dependency
$ npm run build	# build project
$ npm prune --production	# remove development dependencies

## Local build (dev dependency has been installed)
$ npm run build
$ npm prune --production	# remove development dependencies
```

:::info
General installation dependencies specify `NODE_ENV = production` or `npm install-production` only dependencies dependencies are installed when building formal packages. Because the modules in the devDependencies are too large and will not be used in the production environment, unknown problems may also be encountered after installation.
:::


After the build is completed, the `dist` directory of the Midway build product appears.
```bash
➜  my_midway_app tree
.
├── src
├── dist                # Midway build product directory
├── node_modules        # Node.js dependency package directory.
├── test
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```


### Packing compression


After the construction is completed, you can simply package and compress it and upload it to the environment to be released.




### Upload and decompress


There are many ways to upload to the server, such as the common `ssh/FTP/git` etc. You can also use online services such as [OSS](https://www.aliyun.com/product/oss) for transfer.


### Start the project

The project built by Midway is single-process. Whether it adopts `fork` mode or `cluster` mode, single-process code is always easily compatible with different systems, so it is very easy to be loaded by existing tools such as pm2/forever in the community,


Here we use pm2 to demonstrate how to deploy.


Projects generally need an entry file, for example, we create a `bootstrap.js` in the root directory as our deployment file.
```
➜  my_midway_app tree
.
├── src
├── dist                # Midway build product directory
├── test
├── bootstrap.js        # Deployment Startup File
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```


Midway provides a simple way to meet the startup method of different scenarios. All we need to do is install the `@midwayjs/bootstrap` module provided by us (by default, it comes with it).

```bash
$ npm install @midwayjs/bootstrap --save
```

Then write the code in the entry file. Note that the code here uses `JavaScript`.

```javascript
const { Bootstrap } = require('@midwayjs/bootstrap');
Bootstrap.run();
```

Although the code of the startup file is very simple, we still need this file, which is needed in subsequent scenarios such as link tracking.

Note that there is no http startup port here. If you need it, you can refer to the document for modification.

- [Modify the koa port](extensions/koa# Modify Port)

At this time, you can directly use `NODE_ENV = production node bootstrap.js` to start the code, or you can use pm2 to perform the startup.

We generally recommend using tools to start the Node.js project. Here are some documents for advanced reading.

- [Use documentation for pm2](extensions/pm2)
- [cfork documentation](extensions/cfork)



### Startup parameters

In most cases, it is not necessary to configure parameters in the Bootstrap, but there are still some configurable startup parameter options that are passed in through `configure` methods.

```typescript
const { Bootstrap } = require('@midwayjs/bootstrap');
Bootstrap
  .configure({
  	imports: [/*...*/]
  })
  .run();
```



| Property | Type | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| appDir | string | Optional. The project root directory is `process.cwd()` by default. |
| baseDir | string | Optional. The directory of the project code, which is `src` in R & D and `dist` in R & D. |
| imports | Component [] | Optional, explicit component reference |
| moduleDetector | 'file' \| IFileDetector \| false | Optional. The module loading method used. Default value: `file`. You can use the dependency injection local file scanning method. You can explicitly specify a scanner or disable scanning. |
| logger | Boolean \| ILogger | optional. the logger used in the bootstrap. the default value is consoleLogger |
| ignore | string [] | optional. the path ignored by the dependent injection container scan. the moduleDetector is invalid if false |
| globalConfig | Array<{ [environmentName: string]: Record<string, any> }> \| Record<string, any> | Optionally, if the global incoming configuration is an object, it is directly merged into the current configuration in the form of an object. If you want to pass in the configuration of different environments, it is passed in in the form of an array with the same structure and `importConfigs`.  |



**Example: Enter the global configuration (object)**

```typescript
const { Bootstrap } = require('@midwayjs/bootstrap');
Bootstrap
  .configure({
  	globalConfig: {
      customKey: 'abc'
    }
  })
  .run();
```



**Example, incoming sub-environment configuration**

```typescript
const { Bootstrap } = require('@midwayjs/bootstrap');
Bootstrap
  .configure ({
  	globalConfig: [{
      default: {/*...*/}
      unittest: {/*...*/}
    }]
  })
  .run();
```






## Deploy with Docker

### Write Dockerfile and build images


Step 1: Add a Dockerfile to the current directory

```dockerfile
FROM node:12

WORKDIR /app

ENV TZ="Asia/Shanghai"

COPY . .

# If each company has its own private source, it can replace the registry address
RUN npm install --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org

RUN npm run build

# If the port is changed, this side can be updated
EXPOSE 7001

CMD ["npm", "run", "online"]
```


Step 2: Add `.dockerignore` file (similar to git ignore file), you can copy the content of `.gitignore` to `.dockerignore`


Step 3: When using pm2 deployment, change the command to `pm2-runtime start`. For more information about pm2 deployment, see [pm2 container deployment instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2#container-support).


Step 4: build a docker image

```bash
$ docker build -t helloworld.
```

step 5: run docker image

```bash
$ docker run -itd -P helloworld
```

The operation effect is as follows:
![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/187105/1608882492099-49160b6a-601c-4f08-ba65-b95a1335aedf.png)

Then the uppercase `-P` allows us to access `32791` ports because we are assigned a port by default (this `-P` is randomly assigned, and we can also use the `-p 7001:7001` to specify a specific port)

![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/187105/1608882559686-031bcf0d-2185-42cd-a838-80f008777395.png)

For other registry pushed to dockerhub or docker, you can search for the corresponding method.


**Optimization**

We can see that the mirror image we typed in front has more than 1g, which can be optimized:
- 1. We can use a simpler basic image of docker image: for example, node:12-alpine,
- 2. The source code was finally typed in the mirror image. In fact, we don't need this one.

We can also combine the multistage functions of docker to do some optimization. Please note that this function can only be used after `Docker 17.05`.


```dockerfile
FROM node:12 AS build

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

RUN npm run build

FROM node:12-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/bootstrap.js ./
COPY --from=build /app/package.json ./

RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata

ENV TZ="Asia/Shanghai"

RUN npm install --production

# If the port is changed, this side can be updated
EXPOSE 7001

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

The result of the current example is only `207MB`. Compared with the original `1.26G`, it saves a lot of space.

### Combined with Docker-Compose operation

On the basis of docker deployment, you can also deploy some services related to your own services in combination with docker-compose.


**Step 1**

Add dockerfile according to Docker deployment


**Step 2**

The `docker-compose.yml` file is added as follows: (here we simulate our midway project using Redis)

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      -"7001:7001"
    links:
      -redis
  redis:
    image: redis

```


**Step 3: Build**

Use command:

```bash
$docker-compose build
```

**Step 4: Run**

```bash
$docker-compose up -d
```

![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/187105/1608884158660-02bd2d3c-08b4-4ecc-a4dd-a18d4b9d2c12.png)
So how to use redis, for example, because docker-compose has added a redis and link.

For more details about docker-compose, you can see how to use docker-compose online.



## Single file build deployment

In some scenarios, when the project is built as a single file, the deployed files can be smaller and easier to distribute and deploy. In some scenarios, it is particularly efficient, such:

- Serverless scenarios, single files can be deployed faster
- In private scenarios, single files can be more easily encrypted and confused.

Midway supports building projects as single files from v3.

Unsupported situations are:

- Egg project (@midwayjs/web)
- The path form used by the `importConfigs` at the entrance introduces the configured application, components
- Packages that are not explicitly dependent, or have convention-based files in the package

:::info

Currently, it is still in the testing phase.

:::

### Pre-dependency

Single file construction has some pre-dependencies.

```bash
## Used to generate entry
$ npm i @midwayjs/bundle-helper --save-dev

## Used to build a single file
## Pack to Global
$ npm i @vercel/ncc -g
## Or install into the project
$ npm i @vercel/ncc --save-dev
```



### Code adjustment

There are some possible adjustments, listed as follows:

#### 1. Configuration format adjustment

You must adjust the configuration introduced by the project to [Object Mode](./env_config).

The official components of Midway have been adjusted to this mode. If you have your own components, please adjust to this mode to build as a single file.

:::tip

Midway v2/v3 both support configuration loading in "object mode.

:::

```typescript
// src/configuration.ts
import { Configuration } from '@midwayjs/decorator';
import { join } from 'path';

import * as DefaultConfig from './config/config.default';
import * as LocalConfig from './config/config.local';

@Configuration ({
  importConfigs: [
    {
      default: DefaultConfig
      local: LocalConfig
    }
  ]
})
export class ContainerLifeCycle {
}
```



#### 2. Default Export

Due to the default behavior of ncc builders, **do not** use default exports in code related to dependency injection.

For example:

```typescript
export default class UserSerivce {
  // ...
}
```

After compilation, the `UserSerivce` cannot be injected.



#### 3, data source entities related

The scan path that the data source depends on is also not supported.

```typescript
export default {
  typeorm: {
    dataSource: {
      default: {
        // ...
        entities: [
          '/abc',			// not supported
        ]		
      },
  }
}
```

If there are too many entities, you can write a js file, scan out the entities, generate a file to the directory, and execute it every time you build it.



### Build process

Compiling a single file build requires several steps:

- 1. Prepare a single file to build the portal.
- 2. build the project ts file as js
- 3. Use an additional compiler to package all js files into one file

**Step 1**

Modify the `bootstrap.js` of the entry to the following code.

```typescript
const { Bootstrap } = require('@midwayjs/bootstrap');

// Explicitly introduce user code as a component
Bootstrap.configure ({
  // The reference here is the compiled entry, and the local development does not take this file.
  imports: require('./dist/index')
  // Disable directory scanning for dependent injection
  moduleDetector: false
}).run()

```

**Step 2**

Add the following script to `package.json`.

```json
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "bundle": "bundle && npm run build && ncc build bootstrap.js -o build",
    "bundle_start": "NODE_ENV=production node ./build/index.js"
  },
```

Contains three parts

- `bundle` exports all project codes as components and generates a `src/index.ts` file.
- `npm run buid` is a basic ts project. `src/**/*.ts` is built into `dist/**/*.js`
- `ncc build bootstrap.js -o build` uses `bootstrap.js` as the entry point to build a single file, and finally generates `build/index.js`

**Step 3**

Execute the command.

```bash
$ npm run bundle
```

:::tip

note that there may be errors in the build process, such as incorrect ts definition and incorrect entry generation syntax, which need to be manually fixed.

:::

**Step 4**

Start the project.

```bash
$ npm run bundle_start
```

If there is no problem in starting the access, then you can take the built directory and distribute it.



## Deployment failure

After deployment, the situation is more complicated because it is related to the environment. If you encounter problems after deployment to the server, see [Troubleshoot server startup failure](null).
